The aim of the project is to annotate public version of HGMD *(i.e. Human Genome Mutation Database)* with coordinates of mutations for both reference genomes: **hg19** and **hg38**. Moreover, comparison of **HGMD** and **ClinVar mutation database** is done.

Project was successfully completed. Implementation includes working with api of [Mutalyzer utility](https://www.mutalyzer.nl/) and parsing lots of data in different formats.
